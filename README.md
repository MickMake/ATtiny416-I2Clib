# ATtiny416/816 I2C library
This library is comprised of two files, I2C.c and I2C.h which provide full HW based I2C comms to slave devices.
It's a Work In Progress and will probably be incorporated into a much larger library as the beginnings of support for the Arduino & PlatformIO IDEs.

There's also a basic library implementation for the MCP7940 RTC. This is only included to show you how to use the I2C library and isn't required for operation of the I2C library.
